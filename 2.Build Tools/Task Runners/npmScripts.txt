What are NPM Scripts?

NPM scripts are scripts used to automate repetitive tasks like
minifying Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript (JS) files,
deleting temporary files and folders, etc

The Scripts Object in package.json

NPM scripts are written as usual JSON key-value pairs where the key
is the name of the script and the value contains the script you want
to execute. It resides with in scripts object in package.json file.

Special Scripts

There are scripts with names that NPM recognizes and attaches special
meaning to.
Example: npm install, npm prepublish

Calling NPM Scripts Within Other NPM Scripts

Example:

"scripts": {
    "say-hello": "echo 'Hello World'",
    "awesome-npm": "npm run say-hello && echo 'echo NPM is awesome!'"
}
We can use bash scripts also

"scripts": {
    ...
    "clean": "rm -r dist && mkdir dist",
    "build": "npm run clean && webpack"
}

Calling Shell and Node Scripts

1) Create a file called hello.sh in your root directory

#!/usr/bin/env bash

# filename: hello.sh
echo "What's your name?"
read name
echo "Hello there, $name!"

2) Update package.json

"scripts": {
            ..........................
            bash-hello": "bash hello.sh"
            ........................... }
3) Run
   npm run bash-hello
We can also use JS scripts for the same the advantage
is that this script will be platform independent since it uses node to run.
