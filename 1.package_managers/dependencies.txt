1) keep installed packages inside dependencies key section on package.json
2) We don't need ceratin packages like babel or webpack which are used in dev phase, when we are in production we can put these details in a seperate key called devDependencies by
 npm install webpack --save-dev
3) peerDependencies - we will use only if we are creating a new npm package. we can include the package needed for our package to run with in peerDependencies key in package.json
